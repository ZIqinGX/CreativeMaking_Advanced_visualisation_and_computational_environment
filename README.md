# Name of game : 《Tugging Twisting Tracing》

## Game introduction

### Theme： 
### Multiplayer Game, Interactive and playful, Image Generation, Immersive environment, Touch designer


《Tugging Twisting Tracing》is a multiplayer collaborative interactive game which not only provides game experience full of innocence and fun, but also explores a way to record the "trace" of gaming. 

This game requires six players to participate. Two players form one team. 

Before each game, there are three ropes entangled with each other. Two members of the same team stand on each side, holding one end of the rope. The objective of the game is to be the first team to untangle their rope, while players are allowed to climb, jump, and tangle with players from other teams to impede their progress. 

Additionally, the equipment will record the trajectory of players during the game, and generate a unique artistic piece. It is a game that relies on communication and collaboration among team members, and offers a memorable and engaging experience.

## Developing process introduction

This project has two stages. The first stage is on midterm show and it was cooperated with my teammates. At first, it is a real-time game based on jupyter notebook and it generate pictures according to the color and movement of rope.



## concept construction and prototype

## Game Process, also a test
